2024-12-25 14:46:52,404 - INFO - Transcription:  Good morning everyone. I hope you all are doing well. Let's get started with today's meeting. First, I want to go over the project's progress from last week. We made some significant strides in the development of the new feature, but there were a few roadblocks, especially around the API integration. Some unexpected issues have popped up and it seems like we all need to allocate more resources to resolve them. Moving on, we need to review the upcoming deadlines, the project timeline is tight and I want to ensure everyone is aligned with their responsibilities. We also have some bugs reported by the QA team that need immediate action and I'd like to prioritize them during the next trend. As for the release, we are almost there, but we need to finalize the documentation before we officially launch. Thank you.

There are some improvements in which we can make to streamline it and reduce the potential risk. Before we wrap up, let's look at time for question and concerns. Thank you.
