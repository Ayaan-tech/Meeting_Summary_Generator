 In the first meeting, data collection for energy usage is ongoing without major issues, with 50 homes monitored so far. Anomaly detection testing is progressing well, and a predictive model for energy usage forecasting is set to be integrated by the end of the week. The dashboard will use Plotly for better interactivity.

 In the second meeting, updates were given on the skill gap analysis tool. The accuracy has improved by 5%, but further improvements to the user experience are still being worked on. Real-time job market data is also being integrated. The tool's API for pulling job market data is almost complete and should be finalized by the next day. A quick check-in on the data is planned for later in the week. No other updates were provided.
