 Today we reviewed the Q4 product launch plan based on the feedback from the better testing phase. I emphasized the importance of addressing the key issues highlighted by our testers, particularly around the user on boating and performance optimization. I suggested prioritizing a smoother on boating experience by simplifying the registration process and enhancing the tutorial flow. Additionally, we need dedicated resources to improve the app speed and resolve compatibility issues on older versions. We also discussed the promotional strategies for the product launch. Lastly, I proposed hosting a virtual launch event to showcase the product features, inviting key stakeholders and selecting the better testers to share their experiences. Thank you.
