 Hello everyone, today I will go over the main points of our project status and next step steps. First, we have made progress on the front end completing the login and dashboard screens. We aim to finish the user settings by next week. On the backend, the team has integrated the new API. Though they encountered some issues which they are currently addressing. We are aiming for a stable release by the end of this sprint. Moving forward, the design team needs feedback on the final mockups by Thursday. So please prioritize that. Also, we may require additional testing resources next week and I will be looking into options. Let's continue our effort and we will regroup on Monday for further updates. Thanks everyone.
