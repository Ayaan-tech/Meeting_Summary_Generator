 Good morning everyone, let's start with the data collection update, how is it going? The sensors have been fully integrated and data collection is ongoing without major issues. We have captured data from 50 homes focusing on energy usage by different appliances. There are few network hiccups but those have been resolved. That's great to hear, any challenges with data accuracy, nothing significant. We did have some missing data due to brief network outages but our backup system ensured no data was lost. Ok, how is the anomaly detection testing? The testing is progressing very well. The model is detecting unusual energy usage patterns like spikes during of hours. We are looking on refining it to reduce fall sportsatives. Sounds promising. After that we will need to integrate the predictive model for forecasting energy usage. How is the timeline looking for that? We should be ready to start integration by the end of this week. Perfect for the dashboard I recommend using plot beats. It will offer better interactivity for users. Do we agree? Yes, yes. That makes sense. I agree. Any other updates or consoles? Ok. Nothing from me. All good year. Thanks for the hard work everyone. Let's regroup next week to review the progress. Have a great day.
