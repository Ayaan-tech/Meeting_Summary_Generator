 Today I discuss the QFO marketing strategies based on the last quarter's performance. I believe we need to focus more on digital campaigns because traditional methods have not been yielding good results. I also proposed allocating more budget towards social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as engagement on these platforms has been strong. Additionally I suggested investing in influencer partnership which I have shown positive returns in the past. Finally I noted we mainly to revamp the content strategies keep up with the trends particularly focusing on the video content. I will prepare the Nestle data from the follow up meeting to finalize a budget allocation. Thank you. [BLANK_AUDIO] [BLANK_AUDIO] [BLANK_AUDIO] [BLANK_AUDIO]
