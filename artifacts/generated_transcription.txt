 Good morning everyone. I hope you are all doing well. Let's get started with today's meeting. First, I want to go over the project progress from last week. We made some significant strides in the development of the few new feature. But there are a few roadblocks, especially around the API integration. Some unexpected issues have popped up and it seems like we will need to allocate more resources to resolve them. Moving on, we need to review upcoming deadlines. The project timelines is tight and I want to ensure everyone is aligned with their responsibilities. We also have some bugs reported by the QA team that need immediate attention and I would like to prioritize them during the next sprint. As for release, we are almost there, but we need to finalize the documentation before we can officially launch. I had also like to discuss the deployment process. There are some improvements in which we can make to streamline it and reduce the potential risk. Before we wrap up, let's look at time for question and concerns. Thank you.
