 Hello, I discussed today I discussed the Q4 marketing strategies based on the last quarter's performance. I believe we need to focus more on digital campaigns because traditional methods have not been yielding good results. I also proposed allocating more budget towards social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as engagement on these platforms has been strong. Additionally, I suggested investing in influencer partnerships which have shown positive returns in the past. I noted that we may need to revamp the content strategy to keep up with the trends but we will be focusing on the video content and be preparing the necessary data for the follow-up meeting and the budget allocation. Thank you all for attending the meeting.
