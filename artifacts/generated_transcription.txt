 Today I discussed with the Q4 marketing strategies based on the last photos performance and I believe we need to focus more on digital campaigns because traditional methods have not been used in good results. I also proposed allocating more budget towards social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as engagement on these platforms has been strong, additionally as suggested investing the influencer partnerships which have shown post-trip returns in the past. Finally I noted that we may need to revamp the content strategy to keep up with the trends particularly focusing on video content and prepare the necessary data for the follow meeting to finalize a budget allocation. Thank you.
