 Hello everyone, good morning. Let's start our meeting. The first agenda item is the project status update. Sire, could you please provide the latest updates? I just sure the project is on the track as of now. We have completed the initial phase classes. And we are now entering the development stage. The team has finished the UI design and we are waiting for the feedback from the stakeholders. That's great to hear when we expect the start of the plan. The plan will begin by the end of the next week. Depending on the feedback we receive, are there any locals to be needed to be aware of? No or not at the moment. The only concern is the tight timeline for feedback. We need everyone to review the designs by Friday. Okay, let's move on to the next agenda item. That is the budget review. Could you please share the financial status? Yes, the budget is within the limits as of now. I recommend discussing this further in our meeting. Next meetings. Okay, thank you everyone for the contributions. Thank you.
