 Today I discuss the Q4 marketing strategies based on the last quarter's performance. I believe we need to focus more on digital campaigns because traditional methods have not been yielding good results. I also proposed allocating a more budget towards social media platform like Facebook and Instagram as engagement on this platform has been strong. Additionally I suggested investing in influencer partnership which have shown positive returns in the past. Finally, I noted that we may need to revamp the content strategy, keep up with the trends particularly focusing on the video content. I will prepare the necessary data for the follow-up meeting to finalize the budget allocation. Thank you.
