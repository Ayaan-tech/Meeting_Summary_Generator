The aim is to bring together individuals, organizations, and institutions to work towards a common goal of developing India. The journey will consist of various activities such as public meetings, rallies, workshops, and interactive sessions to engage with people and discuss their concerns and expectations. Additionally, there will be a digital component to the program, including a website, social media platforms, and mobile application, to provide information and updates to the public and enable them to participate virtually. The program's success depends on the active participation and support of individuals and organizations across the country.\""
