 Hello, I am Ramsharkhan and today I would like to talk about how I use the Whisper Mic Library for speech to text transcription. First, let me give you a brief overview of what Whisper Mic is. It's a python library that leverages open AI's Whisper model to convert this spoken language into a text. It provides a simple interface for capturing the audio input from a microphone and transcribing into the text. Thank you.
